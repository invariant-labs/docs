### What is Liquid Staking and how does it work for BITZ?

To understand liquid staking, let’s first look at how native staking works.

When you stake your BITZ through the PowPow app, you lock your tokens in exchange for high staking rewards. It’s a solid opportunity, but there’s a limitation. Your BITZ remains locked and cannot be used elsewhere.

This is where liquid staking changes the game.

When you stake your BITZ through Invariant, you receive a Liquid Staking Token called sBITZ. It represents your share in the stake pool, which includes all BITZ staked via Invariant.

The sBITZ program is connected to the BITZ staking program. This means that when you stake BITZ on Invariant, the effect is the same as if you were staking directly through the PowPow app.

### What are the benefits of sBITZ?

Holding sBITZ already gives you an advantage over holding just BITZ. sBITZ is backed by staked BITZ, and its value increases over time compared to the BITZ price.

One key feature is automatic compounding.

### Auto-Compounding

sBITZ introduces a mechanism that automatically compounds you BITZ staking rewards.

Instead of claiming rewards manually and re-staking them yourself, sBITZ program restakes them automatically every 10 seconds. That happens 8,640 times per day.

This matters because staking rewards are based on how much BITZ is staked. By reinvesting rewards back into the pool every few seconds, your total staked balance grows steadily. The more frequent the compounding, the greater the staking rewards.

Simply by holding sBITZ, you are earning much more than you would through native staking. And that’s just the beginning.

### DeFi integration and capital efficiency

sBITZ is a regular token with value. In fact, its value increases over time compared to BITZ. It can be used across the Eclipse DeFi ecosystem.

You can swap it, provide liquidity, borrow or lend it, or use it in strategies that generate additional yield. In essence, you continue earning staking rewards through sBITZ while using that same token in DeFi to earn even more.

One of the first available options is to provide liquidity to the sBITZ - ETH pool on Invariant (link). This allows you to earn trading fees and collect Invariant Points. This is the core of liquid staking. It allows your capital to work in multiple places at once. This approach fully supports Invariant’s mission to maximize capital efficiency.

### Staking rewards and the price of sBITZ

Now let’s look at the relationship between staking rewards and the price of sBITZ.

Since rewards are automatically compounded into the Stake Pool, the value of each sBITZ increases over time. Each sBITZ represents a share in a growing staking pool. As the pool earns more rewards and expands, the value of each sBITZ grows in terms of BITZ.

For example, on day one, you stake your BITZ and receive sBITZ at a one-to-one ratio. At that point, one sBITZ equals one BITZ. After a week, the pool has accumulated additional BITZ from staking rewards. Since the pool is now larger but no new sBITZ has been issued, each sBITZ is worth more. Suppose the new ratio is one sBITZ to 1.5 BITZ.

This is how sBITZ holders see value growth. Rewards are reflected in the price of sBITZ, which increases over time relative to BITZ.

### Benefits for the Eclipse Ecosystem

One of the main motivations behind creating sBITZ was to bring new value, greater efficiency, and especially more liquidity to DeFi on Eclipse. The impact is substantial.

- **Unlocking BITZ Liquidity**

  Currently, over 91% of BITZ is staked. That means most of the supply is illiquid.
  With sBITZ, users can stake and still trade, provide liquidity, or use their capital in yield strategies. This unlocks real liquidity and makes the ecosystem more dynamic.

- **Boosting TVL**

  sBITZ is a separate token and contributes to the chain TVL.
  If $10mln of BITZ is staked through sBITZ, then ten million dollars worth of sBITZ enters circulation.
  This effectively doubles the ecosystem’s TVL from ten to twenty million dollars or more.
  It brings immediate improvements in visibility, scale, and efficiency.

- **Increasing Trading Volume**

  With more liquidity, more trading pairs can be created.
  More trading pairs result in more volume. Pools like sBITZ-ETH, sBITZ-tUSD, and sBITZ-BITZ open new markets and generate additional fees for liquidity providers.

- **Attracting New Users**

  High annual percentage yields always attract attention, especially in new ecosystems.
  sBITZ creates strong incentives for new and existing users to participate without giving up access to their capital.

### Summary

sBITZ is not just a staking token. It is a capital-efficient, yield-optimized asset that benefits users, protocols, and the Eclipse chain as a whole.
You no longer need to choose between staking and using your capital in DeFi.
With sBITZ, you can do both automatically, efficiently, and continuously.
