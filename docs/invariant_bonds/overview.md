### Invariant Bonds


Invariant Bonds is designed for projects that already have a token but need additional funding. It solves the problem projects face when conducting a token sale without knowing what initial price or valuation to set. Often, a project needs to determine its valuation before the token sale, but this can be tricky. Overestimating the price could result in significantly fewer buyers, while underestimating the valuation means not fully capitalizing on the token's potential.

The bonding mechanism adjusts the token price dynamically based on demand. If demand increases, the price rises accordingly. Conversely, if demand decreases, the price falls. In short, the price is determined by the principles of supply and demand.
