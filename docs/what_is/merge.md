### How can you cooperate with Invariant?

- Listing your token: Create liquidity pools. Naturally, creating a pool is fully permissionless and requires less liquidity on Invariant due to concentrated liquidity. It’s also possible to create custom incentives and revenue sharing.
- Program as a service: We are only working on the bonds mechanism, however in the future we’ll probably introduce more.
