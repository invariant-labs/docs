**Invariant Exposure** represents our continued commitment to maximizing the value for users providing liquidity on Invariant. In addition to earning trading fees and Invariant Points, users can unlock exclusive benefits from our partners.

Benefit eligibility is determined by a userâ€™s position on the leaderboard. The higher the rank, the greater the rewards.

These benefits may include:

- **points in partner Points Programs**

- **boosted rewards**

- **discounts on partner products**



Your current exposure is displayed in the [Invariant Points interface](https://eclipse.invariant.app/points).
