### Invariant Points

Invariant Points program is designed to reward our users and show appreciation to those who supported us during the early stages and actively engaged with our protocol.
Users can earn points through various activities on Invariant, such as providing liquidity, making swaps or contributing to the community.

These accumulated points can later be redeemed for exclusive benefits as part of our commitment to our community.
Our goal is for the Invariant Points system to be more than just a loyalty program – it’s an invitation to help us build a strong, trust-driven, and engaged ecosystem.

### Main goal

The ultimate goal is to get our protocol into the hands of users who will find value in using it. The points program aims to attract these users, and incentivize them to stay involved with the protocol.

### Double the Profit

In addition to earning significant fees from providing liquidity, users also gain exposure to the potential for multiple airdrops.
If you’ve ever considered starting your journey with liquidity providing in DeFi, there’s a good chance you won’t find a better time than now.

### Benefits from other projects

Invariant Points participants gain benefits from other projects within and beyond the Eclipse ecosystem, depending on their rank. The higher the position, the more rewards you can unlock. Check the Ecosystem Exposure tab for more details.

### Competition model

The premise of Invariant Points was to create a competitive model among users. Every second, a fixed number of points is distributed and shared among players.

Players whose performance, determined by factors such as TVL, position concentration, and the duration of the position being open, ranks highest will receive the largest share of points. This system incentivizes strategic positioning and rewards efficiency in managing liquidity.

### Outsmarting the whales with less capital

Invariant Points algorithm is the first of its kind in DeFi, designed so that users with smaller amounts of capital aren't automatically set up to fail. How is that possible?

Algorithm takes into account the concentration of a position, not just its TVL. This means that if you're skilled at managing and rebalancing your position, you can potentially score more points than someone with a higher TVL.

We reward both TVL and skill. If you're good at concentrated liquidity, you can make your capital work as if it were larger.

### OG Users

We highly value our OG Users, which is why our algorithm prioritizes them in the initial phase.

Every second, the algorithm distributes a constant number of points. If two identical positions exist in the market during that time, each will receive half of the allocation.

Essentially, being early is advantageous, as the number of positions competing for points will increase with each passing day. This ensures that early users have an advantage at the start.

This points distribution system will be adjusted after the early phase.

### Duration

The Invariant Points Program will run throughout 2025 with no specific end date.

### Getting Started

If you're new to Invariant, the best way to start earning points is by providing liquidity in ETH/USDC pool on Eclipse.
