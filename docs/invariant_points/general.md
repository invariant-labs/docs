The Invariant Points program is designed to reward our users and show appreciation to those who supported us during the early stages and actively engaged with our protocol.
Users can earn points through various activities on Invariant, such as providing liquidity, completing quests, or contributing to the community.

These accumulated points can later be redeemed for multiple airdrops and rewards as part of our commitment to our community.
Our goal is for the Invariant Points system to be more than just a loyalty program – it’s an invitation to help us build a strong, trust-driven, and engaged ecosystem.

### Main goal

The ultimate goal is to get our protocol into the hands of users who will find value in using it. The points program aims to attract these users, and incentivize them to stay involved with the protocol.

### Duration

The Invariant Points Program will run throughout 2025 with no specific end date.

### Rewards

Users of the Invariant Point System will receive allocations for airdrops proportional to the number of points they have accumulated.

There will be at least a few airdrops.
Rewards will be distributed at various stages during the Invariant Points Program based on the number of points users hold at the time, so it’s worth aiming to rank as high as possible from the very beginning.

### Double the Profit

In addition to earning significant fees from providing liquidity, users also gain exposure to the potential for multiple airdrops.
If you’ve ever considered starting your journey with liquidity providing in DeFi, there’s a good chance you won’t find a better time than now.

### OG Users

We highly value our OG Users, which is why our algorithm prioritizes them in the initial phase.
Every second, the algorithm distributes 10,000 points. If there are two identical positions in the market during that time, each will receive 5,000 points. Naturally, TVL is also taken into account, so if one position is twice as large as the other, the points will be distributed in a 2:1 ratio.
Essentially, it’s worth being early, as the number of positions competing for points will increase with each passing day.
This way, early users will have an advantage at the start.
This points distribution system will be adjusted after the early phase.
