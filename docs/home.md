### What is Invariant?

Invariant is a multichain, fully permissionless AMM DEX featuring a concentrated liquidity mechanism. The functionality of the exchange allows retail users to easily swap tokens and efficiently provide their liquidity. The DEX is focused on capital efficiency, the easy addition of new markets by project creators, and a smooth user interface. Our goal is to become the leading DEX on the multiple blockchain, which is why we are open to all forms of cooperation. We originated from Solana and have been live on the Solana mainnet since March 2022. The idea was rewarded at the Solana Riptide Hackathon. Since its launch, Invariant has never experienced any major outages, and its daily average volume is around $5M.

### Invariant Mission

When Invariant was created, its founders set out to solve one of the biggest challenges facing DeFi: the inefficiency of capital utilization and the high barrier to entry for the average user. While many DeFi protocols are powerful in their capabilities, they are often overly complex and difficult for people lacking deep knowledge of finance or blockchain technology to grasp. This complexity, especially in areas such as concentrated liquidity or risk management, often deters users from engaging with these tools, leading to wasted capital and suboptimal usage.
That's unfortunate, as these users miss a great opportunity to achieve high profits, as confirmed by feedback from those who successfully leverage the efficiency of Invariant.

One of the most prominent examples of this complexity is Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs). While highly efficient, CLMMs require users to actively manage their positions and understand intricate mechanics. This complexity prevents many potential users from getting involved, causing them to miss out on the opportunity for higher profits. Moreover, improper use of CLMMs can lead to significant losses. But Invariant is here to change that.

### What problems does Invariant solve?

Invariant was designed to tackle a range of critical issues that have long plagued the DeFi space. These include:

- liquidity separation,
- liquidity inefficiency,
- impermanent loss,
- MEV (Maximal Extractable Value),
- nonoptimal fee structures,
- mercenary liquidity/pool incentivization,
- Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR).

These deeply embedded challenges in current DeFi protocols not only limit the potential for efficient capital use but also introduce risks that discourage broader user participation. By addressing these problems, Invariant is reshaping the way users interact with decentralized liquidity, fostering a more accessible, efficient, and resilient DeFi ecosystem.

### How does Invariant solve these problems?

Our solutions are best suited to the most advanced and efficient blockchains, which, through their high TPS (Transactions per Second) and low fees, provide the optimal environment for effectively addressing these challenges. By leveraging these cutting-edge networks, we ensure that the infrastructure supporting our solutions is not only scalable but also cost-effective. This allows for seamless execution and optimal performance of the tools aimed at overcoming liquidity inefficiencies, impermanent loss, MEV, and other critical DeFi issues we've mentioned before.

We also prioritize newer blockchains, as they are better suited for innovation—not only from a technological perspective but also in terms of their adaptability to emerging concepts. Some of our tools simply wouldn’t be feasible on older blockchain infrastructures. 
This philosophy extends to our development process as well. The Invariant team brings extensive expertise in Rust, which is currently the most efficient and secure language for building smart contracts. This focus on high-performance, secure code is central to our mission and crucial for advancing DeFi development.

###  Bringing our mission to life

We bring our mission to life by actively participating in various hackathons, where we implement our ideas to solve the challenges described above. This hands-on experience also helps us evaluate different blockchain ecosystems and make informed decisions about where to deploy our protocol. We've already achieved significant success, including winning several competitions. Through these experiences, our developers have gained invaluable expertise, allowing us to refine our solutions and pioneer entirely new concepts in DeFi.
