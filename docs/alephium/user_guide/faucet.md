To be able to claim an airdrop from the Invariant platform, we need to have testnet ALPH to pay the network fee for the transaction. Therefore, we need to go through two steps to receive the airdrop.

# Alephium Faucet

1. Open your wallet and click **"Add funds"** button.

3. Your testnet **ALPH** tokens should appear in your wallet after couple seconds.

# Invariant Faucet

Now that you have testnet tokens to approve transactions on the Alephium Testnet, you can request an airdrop from Invariant. You will receive testnet BTC, ETH, and USDC.

1. Click the **"Faucet"** button on [Invariant](https://alph.invariant.app/) site.
