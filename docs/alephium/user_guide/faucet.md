To be able to claim an airdrop from the Invariant platform, we need to have testnet ALPH to pay the network fee for the transaction. Therefore, we need to go through two steps to receive the airdrop.

# Alephium Faucet

1. Open your wallet and click **"Add funds"** button.

2. Confirm by clicking **"Request $ALPH"** button.

3. Your testnet **ALPH** tokens should appear in your wallet after couple seconds.

### Alephium Desktop Wallet

The process for obtaining testnet **ALPH** tokens looks a bit different when using the Alephium Desktop Wallet. If you are using the desktop version, follow this guide.

1. Switch the network to the testnet.

It's important to switch the network to the testnet if you have the mainnet set as the default.

2. Open user setting and go to the **"Developer tools"** tab.

4. Click the **"Receive testnet tokens"** button.

After enabling the developer tools, you should see several options on the screen, including "Receive testnet tokens." Click on this, and after a few seconds, your testnet **ALPH** will appear in your wallet.

# Invariant Faucet

Now that you have testnet tokens to approve transactions on the Alephium Testnet, you can request an airdrop from Invariant. You will receive testnet BTC, ETH, and USDC.

1. Click the **"Faucet"** button on [Invariant](https://alph.invariant.app/) site.
