### Invariant Staker

Invariant Staker is a separate contract that allows for the creation of incentives on a given liquidity pool and rewards the most efficient positions (in practice, the most concentrated ones). In this model, positions that don't generate significant volume are not incentivized, while those that create high volume—and thus earn more fees—are rewarded. The reward tokens are distributed linearly over time. Incentive creation is permissionless, meaning anyone can create it without needing approval.

What makes Invariant Staker unique is:

- **Zero Risk Stake -** You can stake a position without transferring ownership. What does this mean? It means you can stake your position while still keeping it in your own wallet. This significantly increases security. In the event of a smart contract error, you may lose the rewards generated by that position, but not the position itself.
- **Rewards yield -** Since ownership of the position is not transferred, you can stake it across multiple incentives. This allows you to leverage multiple reward opportunities.
