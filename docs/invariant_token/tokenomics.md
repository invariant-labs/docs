### Token Distribution

### Strategic Reserve (45.39%)

**45.39%** of the supply is allocated to the Strategic Reserve, serving as the foundation for Invariant’s long-term growth and stability. This reserve enhances the protocol’s ability to seize new opportunities, maintain resilience, and expand its presence across new ecosystems. By preserving a strong strategic reserve, Invariant ensures it remains adaptable, future-oriented, and well-positioned to drive innovation for years to come.

**Vesting:** 4 years linear vesting with 3 months cliff

### Contributors & Grants (18.89%)

**18.89%** of the supply is allocated to Contributors & Grants, supporting those who have been essential to Invariant’s journey and empowering the builders, developers and partners who will shape its future.

**Vesting:** 4 years linear vesting with 12 months cliff

### Community (17.51%)

**17.51%** of the supply is dedicated to the Invariant community, which stands as the cornerstone of the protocol’s long-term success. This allocation funds the initial airdrop for early adopters, future airdrops that sustain engagement and liquidity incentive programs designed to attract and retain liquidity providers.

- Initial Airdrop: 6.04%

**Vesting:** 100% unlock at TGE

- Future Incentives for Community 11.47%

**Vesting:** 2 years linear vesting with 3 months cliff

### Public Sale (12.09%)

**12.09%** of the supply was allocated to an exclusive community sale, giving early Invariant adopters on Eclipse the opportunity to secure their share in the protocol’s future. This sale highlights the vital role of early supporters in establishing Invariant’s foundation and aligns their interests with the protocol’s long-term growth.
As outlined earlier, the revamped tokenomics strongly favor public sale participants: the reduced supply effectively doubles their relative share compared to the original plan, while also giving them a lower and more favorable FDV.

### Liquidity (6.11%)

**6.11%** of the supply is allocated to ensuring deep and sustainable liquidity across both decentralized and centralized exchanges. This allocation secures stable trading conditions, reduces volatility and supports efficient market participation.

- Liquidity for DEX/CEX at TGE - 3.85%
- Liquidity Reserve for future listings - 2.26%

**Vesting:** 100% unlock at TGE
