### Fee Discount

Invariant implements a fee discount mechanism based on INVT token holdings. This represents a core utility of the INVT token, providing tangible value to holders through reduced trading costs. Users who hold INVT tokens in their wallets can benefit from reduced trading fees when executing swaps on the platform.

### How It Works

The fee reduction is automatically applied when you perform transactions on Invariant. The discount you receive depends on the amount of INVT tokens you hold at the time of the transaction. The system checks your wallet balance and applies the appropriate tier discount to your trading fees.

### Discount Tiers

There are three discount tiers available:

- **Tier 1 - 10% fee reduction**
- **Tier 2 - 25% fee reduction**
- **Tier 3 - 50% fee reduction**

The token thresholds required for each tier are displayed directly in the interface. These thresholds may be adjusted over time to reflect market conditions and protocol needs.

### Benefits

Fee discounts provide INVT holders with a tangible benefit for supporting the protocol. As you increase your holdings, you unlock progressively larger discounts, making your trading activity more cost-efficient. The mechanism creates an incentive structure where active traders are rewarded for holding INVT tokens, while the automatic application ensures you don't need to take any additional steps to receive your discount.
