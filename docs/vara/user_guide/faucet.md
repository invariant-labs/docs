To be able to claim an airdrop from the Invariant platform, we need to have TVARA (Testnet VARA) to pay the network fee for the transaction. Therefore, we need to go through three steps to receive the airdrop.


# Vara Network Faucet


1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [Vara Network Faucet page](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network).
