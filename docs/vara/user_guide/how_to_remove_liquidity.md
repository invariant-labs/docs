2. Next, you'll need to confirm the transaction in your wallet.

After confirming the transaction in your wallet, you'll receive:

- **Withdrawn liquidity** - You'll get back the tokens you provided as liquidity.
- **Unclaimed fees** (if any) - Any fees you haven't claimed yet will also be returned to you.
