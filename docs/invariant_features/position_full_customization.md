title: Position full-customization

**Position full-customization** is the core concept behind Invariant. It was designed for users seeking unconventional and highly customizable options for their positions. Liquidity pools on Invariant are fully permissionless, meaning anyone can utilize Invariantâ€™s services and create their own position on any token without needing approval from anyone.

**Exotic fee tier -** Invariant allows for the creation of positions with unique fee tiers that are not available elsewhere. For example, positions can be opened with a 10% fee tier, which can have a real use case in scenarios like trading meme coins. A pool with such a fee tier supports high price volatility, as it discourages selling during single-digit price movements due to the high fee, making it unprofitable to trade on minor fluctuations.
