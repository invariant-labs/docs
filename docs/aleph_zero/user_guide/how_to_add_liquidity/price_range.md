For greater precision compared to uniform concentration, Invariant offers the option to manually set the price range of your liquidity pool, providing full customization of where you allocate your capital.

To set the price range, simply drag the movable flags on the liquidity chart labeled as **MIN** and **MAX**. Alternatively, you can use buttons to adjust the min and max prices of the range.

In cases where the price range does not cover the current market price, you can still create a specific liquidity pool by adding only one token from the pair. This allows users to participate in providing liquidity, even with a limited range, ensuring flexibility in managing assets within the decentralized exchange ecosystem.
