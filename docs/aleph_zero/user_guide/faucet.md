To be able to claim an airdrop from the Invariant platform, we need to have TZERO (Testnet AZERO) to pay the network fee for the transaction. Therefore, we need to go through three steps to receive the airdrop.

# Changing network to testnet on your wallet 

Before we request an airdrop from [Aleph Zero Faucet](https://faucet.test.azero.dev/), we should make sure that our wallet is switched to Aleph Zero Testnet. We will show how to do it, using [Nightly](https://nightly.app/) as an example.

1. Open **menu** in [Nightly](https://nightly.app/) wallet.
