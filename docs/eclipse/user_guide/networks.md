Blockchain networks come in many forms. These networks serve a variety of purposes, including testing, development, experimentation, and specialized applications. Invariant offers support for a wide range of these networks:

- **Testnet** - Testnets, or testing networks, are intended for users to experiment and test applications in a controlled environment.

- **Devnet** - Devnets, or development networks, are similar to testnets but are specifically intended for developers to build and test applications in a controlled environment.

- **Solana** - [Solana](https://invariant.app/) is an open-source blockchain project. Its architecture is based on Proof of History. The main assumption of its architecture is to prove the existence of a combination of software algorithms set and blockchain implementation which removes software as a performance bottleneck.
