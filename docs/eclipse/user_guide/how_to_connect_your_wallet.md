Before engaging with Invariant, it's imperative to initiate the process by connecting one of our supported wallets. Follow these steps to seamlessly integrate your cryptocurrency wallet with our application:

1. Start by locating the **Connect wallet** button positioned at the top-right corner of the screen. You'll find this button displayed in other areas throughout the app where connecting the wallet is necessary.

2. Upon clicking **Connect wallet**, you'll be prompted to choose a supported wallet that operates on the Eclipse blockchain. This ensures seamless integration with Invariant. You have the flexibility to select a wallet from the list of detected options or opt to scan the QR code provided by Nightly wallet, which we highly recommend.

If you don't have a wallet yet, we recommend choosing one from the following options:

<!-- - [Nightly Wallet](https://nightly.app/)
- [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/)
- [Backpack Wallet](https://backpack.app/) -->

- [Salmon Wallet](https://salmonwallet.io/)
- [Eclipse Wallet](https://docs.eclipse.xyz/users/wallet#salmon-wallet)

3. Once you've successfully connected your wallet, your wallet address will be prominently displayed at the top-right corner of the screen, giving you immediate access to your account information.
