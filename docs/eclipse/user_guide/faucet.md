The Faucet button is designed to provide users with a simple and efficient way to obtain test tokens on a testnet environment. By clicking the button, you will receive a small airdrop of 2 USDC, 0.00005 BTC, and 0.0001 ETH. To receive airdrop, you need to solve a captcha. If the faucet does not work, it is most likely empty and will be refilled soon. For support or help, you can ask on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/w6hTeWTJvG).
