2. Choose the pool from which you wish to claim fees.

3. Upon selecting a specific pool, locate the **Unclaimed fees** section. To collect your profits from the pool, simply click the **Claim fee** button. Any remaining fees will also be automatically returned to you when you close your position.

4. If you opt to collect your fees, you'll need to approve the transaction in your wallet. Once approved, the tokens will be transferred to your wallet address. That concludes the process! Remember, each claim incurs a blockchain transaction, so consider holding onto unclaimed fees to minimize extra fees.
